#Please read me first 

Thanks for taking the time to review my code. I pretty much did most of what you asked. But I didn't run this project with CQRS,i just implemented that by Event Sourcing. Because I had no experience in DDD and CQRS. In last three days, I have read many articles about CQRS and DDD and I want to thank you for this challenge and this exam.i know you are a high level company and of course it is my pleasure to be your colleague in future.
I had a hard week and I didn't have enough time, and I spent 4 more hours in traffic every day. Of course, if I had more time, I could give you a more complete project.
I learned a lot of thing by your challenge. I love any challenge.
